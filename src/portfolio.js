  <>
  <br /> <br /> Thanks for stopping by!
  <br /> <br /> I'm Jacob, an Atlanta, Georgia native and a PhD student / Masters student / Associate Academic Professional at the Georgia Institute of Technology. On the side, I am an avid singer and CrossFitter!
  <br /><br />
  My passion lies in creating the algorithms that power next-generation intelligent systems—think autonomous vehicles, humanoid robots, and the technologies that bring them to life. 
  <br /><br />
  My research focuses on securing networked robotics by exploring how adversaries might attack these systems; I develop novel methods with mathematical frameworks based in control theory, cybersecurity, and machine learning to defend against such attacks.
  <br /><br />
  As much as I love research, I’m equally devoted to teaching. I thrive on helping students navigate the complexities of robotics and control theory, sparking their curiosity, and fostering the next wave of engineers.
  <br /><br /> When I'm not in the lab or classroom, I am singing as a bass vocalist for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Choir or with a jazz quartet... or I'm probably in the gym.
  <br /><br /> Take a look around and feel free to reach out via the "Contact Me" tab, I'd love to get to know you!
